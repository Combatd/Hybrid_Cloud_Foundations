## Chapter 1: Journey to the Modern Hybrid Cloud

1. What the role of a Hybrid Cloud Engineer is

2. The different models to support various Cloud initiatives

3. The Engineerâ€™s role in Service Level Agreements related to Cloud apps

4. How to choose the optimal Cloud platform for an app, based on business requirements and SLAs

### What does a Hybrid Cloud Engineer do?

A hybrid cloud engineer can design, create, operate, and manage different types of workloads across multiple clouds and infrastructure providers.

The engineer should be able to:

* Consult and plan with business stakeholders
* Successfully execute this plan
* Validate outcomes through their technical skillset
The Hybrid Cloud Engineer helps organizations determine their readiness, and make suggestions if an organization isn't ready yet. One of the most important things to check is if business requirements are clearly defined. This is done through Service Level Agreements, or SLAs, need to be completely documented and enforceable. This is what you're going to use to choose the right infrastructure for every service.

This is followed by ```implementation```.

```Implementation``` involves planning and executing migration. This involves a few things like refactoring applications for the best possible Total Cost of Ownership, or TCO, and Return On Investment, or ROI. Once complete, the technical and organizational infrastructure needs to be continuously monitored to check if performance expectations that were created in the SLAs are met.

### Understanding the Cloud
NIST defines cloud computing as "a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources. For instance: networks, servers, storage, applications, and services that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction."

* With Infrastructure as a Service, or IaaS, you are only managing the workloads and applications that are running on virtual machines and containers.

* With Platform as a Service, or PaaS, you are only responsible for applications and their data.

* Finally, with a Software as a Service, or SaaS, model, every aspect of the infrastructure is provided to you. The only thing that you are required to manage is the data. Everything else is being managed by a provider.

Starting an organization's digital transformation:
1. How do you leave traditional IT behind and become a Cloud consumer?
2. How do you choose between application hosts? Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, or Software as a Service?
3. How does your choice impact workload design, deployment, management, and costs?
4. Can you leverage multiple models effectively?
