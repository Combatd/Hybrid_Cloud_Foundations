### What does a Hybrid Cloud Engineer do?

A hybrid cloud engineer can design, create, operate, and manage different types of workloads across multiple clouds and infrastructure providers.

The engineer should be able to:

* Consult and plan with business stakeholders
* Successfully execute this plan
* Validate outcomes through their technical skillset
The Hybrid Cloud Engineer helps organizations determine their readiness, and make suggestions if an organization isn't ready yet. One of the most important things to check is if business requirements are clearly defined. This is done through Service Level Agreements, or SLAs, need to be completely documented and enforceable. This is what you're going to use to choose the right infrastructure for every service.

This is followed by ```implementation```.

```Implementation``` involves planning and executing migration. This involves a few things like refactoring applications for the best possible Total Cost of Ownership, or TCO, and Return On Investment, or ROI. Once complete, the technical and organizational infrastructure needs to be continuously monitored to check if performance expectations that were created in the SLAs are met.
